## Intro

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Originally [forked](https://github.com/RyukyuColin/nextjs-starter-app) from [mschwarzmueller](https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/nextjs-course-code) and followed his [simple tutorial](https://youtu.be/MFuwkrseXVE) to build out some CRUD. I continued development by implementing a refactored MongoDB integration along with data model isolation.

Purpose of this project is to test the capabilities of Next.js for future development on other projects.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
